The study required balancing rigorous methodology with practical constraints of access and security in some target areas.

Climate data analysis provided historical context on temperature and rainfall patterns. Household surveys captured socioeconomic conditions and coping strategies across representative samples. Key informant interviews with government officials, traditional leaders, and technical experts provided institutional perspectives. Participatory community assessments engaged local stakeholders in vulnerability mapping and adaptation priority-setting. We synthesized findings through collaborative analysis workshops with the donor and partners.",deliverables:["Comprehensive baseline assessment report","Climate vulnerability profiles by state and community","Institutional capacity assessment findings","Community adaptation practice inventory","GIS vulnerability maps","Program design recommendations","Stakeholder validation workshop report","Policy brief for government engagement"],results:["Comprehensive vulnerability profiles for target communities","Identified locally-appropriate adaptation strategies","Assessed institutional capacity for climate response","Informed evidence-based program design"]};function o(){return a.jsx(s.Z,{...r})}}};var t=require("../../../webpack-runtime.js");t.C(e);var i=e=>t(t.s=e),a=t.X(0,[200,992,614],()=>i(4939));module.exports=a})();
