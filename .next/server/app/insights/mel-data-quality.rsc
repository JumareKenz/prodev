Without reliable data, programs cannot track progress, identify problems, or demonstrate results.

This article outlines practical approaches to ensuring data quality throughout the program cycle."}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"The Dimensions of Data Quality"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Data quality is multifaceted. High-quality data should be valid (measuring what it claims to measure), reliable (producing consistent results), timely (available when needed), complete (covering all relevant cases), precise (sufficiently accurate), and integrity-protected (safeguarded from tampering). Each dimension requires attention throughout the data lifecycle—from collection through analysis and reporting."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Programs often focus narrowly on accuracy while neglecting other dimensions. Data that is accurate but arrives months after it is needed cannot inform timely decisions. Data that is precise but incomplete may produce misleading conclusions. Comprehensive data quality assurance requires attention to all dimensions."}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Designing for Quality"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Data quality begins with design. Well-designed data collection instruments reduce errors at the source. Clear operational definitions ensure that different data collectors interpret indicators consistently. Appropriate sampling strategies balance rigor with feasibility. And digital data collection tools with built-in validation rules catch errors in real-time."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Investing in design pays dividends throughout implementation. Programs that rush through instrument development often spend far more resources cleaning data and managing inconsistencies than programs that invest upfront in quality design. Pilot testing instruments before full-scale rollout identifies problems while they are still easy to fix."}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Building Quality into Processes"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Quality is not a one-time event but a continuous process. Data quality assurance should be embedded in routine workflows rather than treated as a periodic audit. This means establishing data entry protocols that include verification steps, implementing automated checks that flag outliers and inconsistencies, and creating feedback loops that return data quality reports to collection points."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Training and supervision are critical. Data collectors need to understand not just what to collect but why quality matters. Regular supervision provides opportunities to observe collection practices, identify systematic errors, and reinforce good practices. Supervisors should review data while collection is ongoing, not wait until reporting deadlines to discover problems."}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Verification and Validation"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Data quality assessments should go beyond desk reviews to include verification activities. Source document verification compares reported data against original records. Spot checks confirm that reported activities actually occurred. And data quality audits systematically assess collection, management, and reporting processes against established standards."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Validation assesses whether data accurately represents the phenomena it claims to measure. This may involve comparison against external data sources, triangulation across different collection methods, or qualitative exploration of discrepancies. Validation is particularly important for indicators that are abstract or subject to reporting bias."}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Using Data Quality Findings"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Data quality assessments are only useful if their findings lead to action. Programs should establish thresholds for data quality below which data cannot be used for decision-making. When quality falls below these thresholds, root cause analysis should identify whether problems stem from instruments, processes, capacity, or incentives—and corrective actions should target these root causes."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Transparency about data quality is essential.
